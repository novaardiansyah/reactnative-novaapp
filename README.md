# Nova React Native Application
Hi Future Developer,

Welcome to my latest project! This is a React Native application designed for both Android and iOS devices, created to help manage finances, record important information, track sales, and handle various daily utilities.

While this application was initially developed for personal use, I have made the source code and a limited version of the API publicly accessible. You can find the API repository at [novaapp-api](https://github.com/novaardiansyah/novaapp-api). Please note that sensitive information such as environment variables, tokens, and direct database access are not included or shared.
