# Nova React Native Application

Hi Future Developer,

Welcome to my latest project! This project is a React Native application that I have been working on. I have been using React Native to build a mobile application that can be used on both Android and iOS devices.

This application was developed to meet my personal needs, such as managing finances, recording important information, tracking sales, and handling various other utilities I use on a daily basis.

Although this application is personal, I have made the source code publicly accessible. However, please note that there are certain limitations, such as no access to the database or the APIs used within the application.
